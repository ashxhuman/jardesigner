  "main": "This section defines the plots that will be generated by the simulation. Each plot can visualize a specific variable from any part of the model over time or space.",
  "fields": {
    "path": "The primary morphological path where the variable to be plotted is located (e.g., 'soma', 'dend', '/cell/dend[2]').",
    "field": "The specific variable or field to be plotted (e.g., 'Vm' for membrane potential, 'Ca' for calcium concentration).",
    "chemProto": "For plotting chemical variables (when 'Field' is 'conc', 'n', etc.), select the chemical prototype this plot refers to. For non-chemical variables, this should be '.'.",
    "childPath": "A relative path from the main 'Path'. For chemical fields, this specifies the target object within the chemical model. For other fields, this can point to a child object like a specific channel instance (e.g., 'Na_HH').",
    "title": "An optional custom title for the plot. If left empty, a default title will be generated.",
    "mode": "The type of plot to generate. 'time' plots a variable at a point over time. 'space' plots a variable along a path at a single time point. 'wave' creates an animated space plot over time. 'raster' is for spike times.",
    "yMin": "Optional. The minimum value for the Y-axis of the plot. If set to 0, the minimum value will be determined automatically.",
    "yMax": "Optional. The maximum value for the Y-axis of the plot. If set to 0, the maximum value will be determined automatically.",
    "waveFrames": "The number of frames to generate for an animated 'wave' plot. This field is only active when the mode is set to 'wave'."
