  "headings": {
    "prototypes": "This section is for defining the different types of ion channels. You can create multiple 'prototypes' from built-in models or load them from external NeuroML files.",
    "distributions": "This section is for defining the rules that place your channel prototypes onto the neuron's surface and set their density."
  },
  "prototypes": {
    "type": "Select the base model for the ion channel. Choosing 'File' allows you to specify a custom NeuroML channel definition.",
    "file": "Specify the path to the NeuroML file defining the channel (e.g., 'MyChannels/NaV.channel.nml'). This is only used when the 'Type' is set to 'File'.",
    "name": "A unique name for this channel prototype. It defaults to the 'Type' but can be edited to be more descriptive, which is useful if you have multiple versions of the same channel type."
  },
  "distributions": {
    "prototype": "Select which of the defined channel prototypes to distribute with this rule.",
    "path": "The morphological path where channels will be placed (e.g., 'soma', 'axon', 'dend', or a specific path like '/cell/dend[0]/branch[1]').",
    "maxConductance": "The maximum conductance density (Gbar) for this channel at this location. The units depend on the specific channel model but are typically in Siemens per square meter (S/m^2).",
    "caTau": "The time constant for calcium decay, in seconds (s). This parameter is only applicable when distributing a calcium concentration prototype ('Ca_conc')."
